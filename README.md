# **UFO Sightings – Cleaned & Unified Dataset (~327k rows)**

This dataset merges several publicly available UFO sighting datasets from Kaggle into one **cleaned**, **standardized**, and **enriched** file.
The goal is simply to provide a consolidated dataset instead of many fragmented sources with inconsistent formatting.

This release contains **a single JSONL file** with approximately **327,000 records**.

No private or identifying information was present in the original data.

---

## **📦 Source**

All entries originate from publicly available UFO sighting datasets on **Kaggle**.
Each row corresponds to a single reported sighting.

---

## **🧹 Cleaning / Normalization Performed**

All rows in this unified file were standardized using the same basic rules:

* timestamps parsed and converted into a consistent `t_utc` (ISO-8601, UTC)
* city/state/country fields harmonized where possible
* latitude/longitude coerced to floats
* basic HTML/unicode cleanup in free-text descriptions (`text`)
* invalid or fully unparseable rows removed
* source field preserved as `src`

No interpretation or filtering based on content was performed.

---

## **✨ Added Contextual Fields**

A small number of lightweight “sidecar” fields were added based on timestamp + coordinates:

* **`moon_illum`** — moon illumination fraction
* **`moon_alt_deg`** — moon altitude in degrees
* **`nearest_airport_code`** — closest airport (ICAO)
* **`nearest_airport_km`** — distance to that airport in km
* **`wx_bucket`** — rough weather bucket (coarse category)

These values are approximate and should be treated as exploratory metadata only.

---

## **🧩 Clustering Fields (Included in the File)**

The dataset includes two fields that come from text-similarity grouping:

* **`cluster_id`** — numeric label
* **`prob`** — membership confidence

These reflect **text similarity**, not verified categories or event types.
They are included because they were already part of the cleaned file.

## **⚠️ Notes & Limitations**

* Accuracy of timestamps and locations depends entirely on original reporting.
* Weather buckets are coarse (not NOAA-grade).
* Airport distances are approximate nearest-neighbor lookups.
* Cluster labels are based solely on text similarity and do **not** reflect event reality.
* No claims are made about the nature or validity of any sighting.
